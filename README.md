## Overview
This project is a Spring Boot application that implements JWT-based authentication. It provides a secure way of handling user authentication using JSON Web Tokens (JWT). The application exposes a REST API endpoint for authentication, allowing users to obtain a JWT upon providing valid credentials. This token can then be used for authorizing subsequent requests to other protected endpoints in the application.

## Task 1:
- Hard coded authentication service that returns tokens if the credentials supplied match.
- [Spring JWT](https://github.com/Evin-Ngoa/sbg-forage-virtual-experience/tree/main/auth-service/) Repository

## Task 2:
- Python script designed to be deployed as an AWS Lambda function.
- [Lambda Function](https://github.com/Evin-Ngoa/sbg-forage-virtual-experience/tree/main/auth-service/) Repository
